# TraversyArrayPractice

Hi there!

This repo is comprised of the three JS array cardio sessions from Traversy Media. Here are the links to the YouTube videos:

Session 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2bJBuaOeOQ

Session 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfchU1FS2IA

Session 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcoiPHktCwQ

In this repo each of the folders corresponds to each of the YouTube Videos. I solved the coding challenges using JS just like in the video's, but some of my solutions are a little different from what is show. This is simply because I went with the solution or solutions that made the most sense to me when going through the lessons. 

Check out some of the other Coding Challenges I've completed:
